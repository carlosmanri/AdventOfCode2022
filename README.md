#### Notes

##### Day 07

Made in WSL with the debian distribution. I solved the problem by modifying the input to generate a file system equal to the one in the statement. Unfortunately, in a real file system, directories also occupy bytes, block size matters, etc. Therefore, the output of the script on the actual filesystem is different from the expected response in aoc2022. The way I see it, my goal with today was to understand some command line utilities a bit better rather than to improve tree traversal. Moral victory
